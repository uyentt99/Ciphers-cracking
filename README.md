# RSA
Create folder RSA in a project to run file 

keyRSA contain: creatkey and find p,q from n 

input1: input for cryption with downcase englist text, e, n 

input2: input for cracking: e,n and Cipher can be make form encryptionRSA

othercode: power(a,b,BASE) calcular a modul b mod BASE

           extGCD is: Extended Euclidean algorithm
# for n: must big enough to can change between encode and text
